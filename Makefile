# Release pipeline. The version lives in drf_pydantic_ai/version.py (pyproject
# pulls it in via [tool.hatch.version] dynamic). The three targets below wrap
# scripts/release-publish.sh, which is the single source of truth for the flow
# and stays byte-identical across the services + mcp-server repos.
#
#   release-publish-prepare   — version short-circuit, pytest, uv build, extract
#                               CHANGELOG section. Called by release.yml on every
#                               push to main; no-ops unless the version was
#                               bumped past the most recent vX.Y.Z tag.
#   release-publish-finalize  — tag vX.Y.Z, push it, create the GitHub Release.
#                               Called after PyPI publish succeeds in CI.
#   release-publish           — prepare → uv publish → finalize. For end-to-end
#                               workstation releases. Set DRY_RUN=1 to rehearse.
