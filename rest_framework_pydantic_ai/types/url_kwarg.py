"""``UrlKwarg`` — re-exported from drf-services, which now owns the type.

The declaration is identical whichever transport carries it, and this package's
copy had drifted from ``djangorestframework-mcp-server``'s: the two validated the
same declaration against different reserved-name sets, so ``UrlKwarg("user")``
was legal here and rejected there, and ``UrlKwarg("order")`` the reverse.
``djangorestframework-services`` 0.28 owns the single definition, which also
carries the new ``required`` flag.

The import path here is preserved permanently — ``from rest_framework_pydantic_ai
import UrlKwarg`` keeps working, so consumers need only a version bump. New code
may import from either location; they are the same class.
