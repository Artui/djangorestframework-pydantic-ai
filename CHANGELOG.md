## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- `SpecToolset` — a Pydantic-AI toolset that exposes
  `djangorestframework-services` services and selectors as agent tools. Each
  call routes through drf-services' transport-neutral surface (`dispatch_spec`
  plus its off-HTTP helpers `build_offline_context` / `enforce_permissions` /
  `spec_to_json_schema` / `render_spec_output`) — **no MCP server and no AG-UI
  bridge** in the path. The toolset enforces `spec.permission_classes` (which
  `dispatch_spec` deliberately does not), builds the off-HTTP request/view
  context, derives each tool's description and `readOnlyHint` annotation from
  the spec, and exposes `page` / `limit` / `order` tool args for list selectors.
  Validation errors map to `ModelRetry`, business errors and unresolved
  instances to a model-readable `{"error": ...}`.
- `AgentDeps` — the default `user`-carrying dependency the toolset reads off
  `RunContext.deps`; override with a `get_user` extractor for a custom identity
  shape.
